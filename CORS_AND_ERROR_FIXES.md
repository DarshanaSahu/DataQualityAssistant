# CORS and JSON Parsing Error Fixes

This document explains the fixes implemented to resolve CORS issues and JSON parsing errors with the `suggest-rules` endpoint.

## CORS Configuration Improvements

1. Enhanced the CORS middleware configuration in `app/main.py`:
   - Added multiple allowed origins, including `http://localhost:5173` and `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
   - Explicitly listed allowed methods: `["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS", "PATCH", "*"]`
   - Added comprehensive header configurations
   - Set a max age for CORS caching

2. Added proper CORS-compatible error responses to ensure all API responses have appropriate CORS headers, even during errors.

## JSON Parsing Error Fixes

The `{"table_name": "authors", "new_rule_suggestions": [], "rule_update_suggestions": [], "error": "Failed to generate suggestions: Expecting value: line 39 column 25 (char 1827)"}` error has been fixed with these improvements:

1. Enhanced error handling in `scan_table_for_rule_suggestions`:
   - Added detailed logging of JSON parsing errors
   - Implemented multiple fallback methods for parsing JSON from Claude's responses:
     - First tries direct JSON parsing
     - Then attempts to extract JSON from code blocks
     - Then searches for JSON object boundaries
     - Cleans malformed JSON (fixing trailing commas, etc.)
     - As a last resort, extracts individual rule objects

2. Added improved error handling throughout the API:
   - All endpoints now return proper JSON responses even during errors
   - Status codes are correctly set (404 for missing resources, 500 for server errors)
   - Detailed error messages are provided

3. Added detailed logging throughout the application:
   - Logs include detailed information about request processing
   - JSON parsing errors are logged with position information
   - All exceptions are captured and logged

## Database Utilities

Added a new `db_utils.py` module with utility functions:
- `table_exists()`: Safely checks if a table exists in the database
- `get_column_names()`: Gets a list of column names for a table
- `get_column_data_types()`: Gets data types for each column

## Testing the Fixes

To test that the CORS and JSON parsing issues are fixed:

1. Start the server with `python run_with_cors_debug.py`
2. Access the application from http://localhost:5173
3. Try generating rule suggestions for the `authors` table
4. Check the server logs for detailed information about any issues

If debugging is needed:
1. The server logs will show detailed information about CORS requests/responses
2. JSON parsing errors will be logged with position information
3. The fallback mechanisms should ensure a valid response even when Claude returns unexpected formats

## Additional Notes

- The CORS debug middleware can be enabled/disabled in `run_with_cors_debug.py`
- The application now has multiple layers of error handling to ensure robust operation
- If Claude's responses continue to cause JSON parsing issues, additional examples of well-formed JSON can be added to the prompts
